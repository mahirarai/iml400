[Cybernetic Garden](https://mahirarai.github.io/iml400/cybernetic-garden/) is an interactive web page inspired by the poem All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace by by Richard Brautigan:

> "I like to think (and the sooner the better!) of a cybernetic meadow where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony like pure water touching clear sky.
> I like to think (right now, please!) of a cybernetic forest filled with pines and electronics where deer stroll peacefully past computers as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms. 
> I like to think (it has to be!) of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to the mammal brothers and sisters, and all watched over by machines of loving grace."


### Description

This cybernetic garden aims to transport the viewer to a memory and create an interface to play within. It is a portfolio of my own photographs that have been distorted to depict the ways memories change and shift as they get passed on through space and time. I wanted to think about distortion as another facet of reality, while also thinking about how technology relies on distortion to influence the ways we understand and perceive our world, relationships, and identity. 

Inspired by the imagery of deers in a field with flowers and computers, I was imagining how technology might have to change or be used differently to be harmonic with our natural way of life; where we are able to have our own autonomy. Technology allows us to gain access to things quickly, get things done faster, and push away the things we don’t like. When I think of a garden, I imagine a place that is simple, abundant, and slow. I was inspired by the words of the poem, particularly, “I like to think,” because so much of technology is about us not having to think, or think deeply. I wanted to imagine a cybernetic garden as a playground, and as a place to observe, be bored, slow down, and be with ourselves.
